= Required hardware =

To run a Sigmah or ActivityInfo Server, you will need to have a machine with the following requirements:


|| *Application type* || Java web application (for information: 30Mb .war file) ||
|| *Server type* || Java application server (Jetty recommended but working also with Tomcat) accepting Hibernate, or dedicated server ||
|| *Database type* || The current version has been tested with PostGreSQL 9 (recommended until bug [http://sigmah.org/issues/view.php?id=210 0000210: MySQL connection implicitly closes after a while] gets fixed) and MySQL 5.5. It is possible to configure Sigmah to work with [http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases other databases], but these have not been tested and may not work. ||
|| *Processor* || 2Ghz recommended, dual-core if possible ||
|| *Live memory* || 2Gb recommended ||
|| *Hard drive* || At least 50Gb, but depends strongly on the volume of data and files stored by the user of the organization ||
