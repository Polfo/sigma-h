= Audience =

This document is for those who wish deploy and run ActivityInfo on their own server. 
Since those in the UN are often coming from a .NET background, the specifics in this 
guide are for the Windows platform.

= Required Software =

To run an !ActivityInfo Server, you will need to install the following software:

  # [http://download.java.net/jdk6/ JDK, v1.6]
  # [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi Apache Tomcat 6.x]. There is a convenient Windows Service Installer available on the download page
  # Download a ready-to-run version of the !ActivityInfo server, a ".war" archive, from the [http://code.google.com/p/activity-info/downloads/list downloads] page.

If you do not already have an SQL Server installation running, you can download and set up SQL Server Express 2005. 

  # [http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2005/en/us/express-down.aspx Microsoft SQL Server Express 2005]
  # [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C243A5AE-4BD1-4E3D-94B8-5A0F62BF7796&displaylang=en Microsoft Management Studio Express]

!ActivityInfo has not been tested with SQL Server 2008, but that should work as well.
