#labels Featured

= Audience =

This document is for those who wish deploy and run ActivityInfo on their own server. 
Since those in the UN are often coming from a .NET background, the specifics in this 
guide are for the Windows platform.

= Required Software =

To run an ActivityInfo Server, you will need to install the following software:

  # [http://download.java.net/jdk6/ JDK, v1.6]
  # [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi Apache Tomcat 6.x]. There is a convenient Windows Service Installer available on the download page

If you do not already have an SQL Server installation running, you can download and set up SQL Server Express 2005. 
ActivityInfo has not been tested with SQL Server 2008, but that should work as well:

  # [http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2005/en/us/express-down.aspx Microsoft SQL Server Express 2005]
  # [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C243A5AE-4BD1-4E3D-94B8-5A0F62BF7796&displaylang=en Microsoft Management Studio Express]


= Install Download the latest WAR = 

A ready-to-run version of the ActivityInfo server is available as a Web Archive (WAR) from the downloads page.
