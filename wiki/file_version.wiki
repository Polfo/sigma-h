=Table file_version=
==Remarks==
The table file_version contains all versions of each file. Each version is stored in the filesystem and can be retrieved with this table. 
Deleted versions in the database are not deleted on the filesystem in order to retrieve them if the user had made a mistake. But these files are hidden from the view.
