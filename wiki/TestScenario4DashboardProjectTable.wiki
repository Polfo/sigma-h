= Introduction =

This scenario is based on the demo data set.


= Test cases =

== DPT1 ==
=== _Title:_ User signing in ===
=== _See test on:_ [TestScenario4UserSessionRight#USR1] ===

== DPT2 ==
=== _Title:_ Projects table loading ===
<table border="1"><th> *#* </th><th> *Steps to reproduce* </th><th> *Expected result* </th>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> Just after signing in, the user sees the projects table getting loaded. </td><td> - A progress bar show the progress of the loading of the projects in the table
- The projects table has the following column shown by default
  * code
  * title
  * current phase
  * organizational unit
  * budget consumption
  * available time consumption
  * activity progress
  * categories to which this project belongs to </td></tr></table>


== DPT3 ==
=== _Title:_ Global export live data ===
<table border="1"><th> *#* </th><th> *Steps to reproduce* </th><th> *Expected result* </th>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> From the projects table, click on the "Export all" button </td><td> The Global export popup opens up. </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> Let the "Live data" checked by default and click on the "Export" button. </td><td> After a while, an Excel file should be proposed to be downloaded. </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> Save the Excel file on your hard drive and open it. </td><td> The Excel file should contain a tab per project model which has projects associated to it.
In each tab, all the fields of the project model should be given as column and each row should be a project.
All projects, except test and deleted projects, should be in one or another tab of this Excel file. </td></tr></table>
