=== _Title:_ Timezone difference management ===
|| *#* || *Steps to reproduce* || *Expected result* || 
|| 1 || Log out from Sigmah. || You're back to login screen. ||
|| 2 || Change the timezone of your operating system to a timezone which is different from the timezone where the Sigmah server you're connected to is located. For example, if you're connected to demo.sigmah.org which is a server located in France, you should change the timezone of your operating system (ie: Ubuntu, MS Windows, MacOS) to a timezone which is not the Paris timezone. || After changing the timezone, the current time of your computer should be different from the time on your watch or mobile phone. ||
|| 3 || Log in with the demo@sigmah.org / sigmah credentials. || You're now on the main dashboard. ||
|| 4 || Open the IF1389 project, and then click on the "Details" sub-tab. || ||
|| 5 || Change the start date of the project, and click on the "Save" button. || You get a message "Your data has been correctly saved". ||
|| 6 || Open the "Indicator Data Entry" tab. ||  ||
|| 7 || Enter a value in an empty cell for an indicator, and click on the "Save" button. || Once "Save" is clicked, the button switched to disabled state and is renamed "Saved".  ||
|| 8 || Log out from Sigmah. || You're back to login screen. ||
|| 9 || Change the timezone of your operating system to a timezone which is different similar to the timezone where the Sigmah server you're connected to is located. ||  ||
|| 10 || Log in with the demo@sigmah.org / sigmah credentials. || You're now on the main dashboard. ||
|| 11 || Open the IF1389 project, and then click on the "Details" sub-tab. || The start date in the project banner and in the field of the "Details" sub-tab should have the same value as the one you've entered when your operating system was set to a different timezone. ||
|| 12 || Open the "Indicator Data Entry" tab and search for the Month view where you've entered a new indicator value previously (you must be in a "Month" view, and not in an "Indicator" or "Site" view) || The value you've entered previously is still visible and is unchanged.  ||
