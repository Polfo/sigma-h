"Issue-tracking driven development" could be summarized as "tell what you'll do, and do what you've told".

All commits should be linked with an issue in the issue tracker.

In order to ease this linkage process between the commit and the issue tracker, a script has been added. If strings like the following are included in the commit comment, the changeset of the commit should be automatically added to the issue details:
 * issue 45
 * issue #45
 * Issue 45
 * ISSuE #45
 * issue 0000045
