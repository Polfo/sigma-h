= Modifications Proposed = 

== OrganizationalUnit ==

Collapse "Zone d'Intervention", "Base Operationnelle" and "DÃ©partment" into single "OrganizationalUnit" entity. An Organization *posseses* a root OrganizationalUnit, and OrganizationalUnits can *manage* any number of subordinate units. 

Rationale:
  * NGOs can have very different structures, I think it's best to rest generic rather than imposing a single structure on all organizations (e.g. Base Operationnelle, Department, Zone d'Intervention) 

An OrganizationalUnit _can_ have a Location (which is associated with a single Country) which represents the Unit's physical location for the purposes of mapping. [http://www.pear.cd/contenu/cartes/PEAR%20Contacts%20-%20Point%20Focaux%202009%2005%2012.pdf example] 

An OrganizationalUnit, however, does not carry geographic constraints.

Rationale: it is not uncommon for field offices to take on projects outside of their nominal geographic responsibility. For example:
  * IRC's Pakistan office carried out projects in Afghanistan for a number of years pre-2001
  * UNICEF's DRC office provided assistance to refugees in neighboring Congo-Brazaville
  * Projects in the IDPs camps around Hombo, North Kivu, are most frequently managed by NGO's field offices in South Kivu because they are close to the border and inaccessible from Goma.

Projects are linked to geography through Project->Site->Location. See GeographyObjectModel.


== Project == 

The relationship between a Project and an !OrganizationalUnit should many-to-many. The reality is that projects typically bring together a number of Organizations and !OrganizationalUnits.

For example, large NGOs often have parallel geographic and technical structures. A project to rehabilitate schools will be "line" managed by: 
  * The Katanga sub-office, who will have final say over all things logistic, financial, and HR, 
  * The Education Technical Unit (based in NY for IRC, based in Kinshasa for UNICEF) who is responsible for assuring good project design.

At the same time, nearly all projects involve multiple organizations. For example, the same education project will also involve:
  * The Education Ministry, who are invited to participate in the design of the project and its monitoring, for the sake of assuring the sustainability of the project.
  * The local NGO or contractor who will do the actual rehabilitation 

In addition, each Project is *owned* by a single User, who is the User that created the Database and has the initial rights to make associations with !OrganizationalUnits and Users. 

== Permissions == 

User Permissions need to be established at two levels: the OrganizationalUnit level, and the Project level.

=== Project-level Permissions ===

The Owner of a Project can grant additional Users the right to participate in a project on behalf of one of the OrganizationalUnits participating in the project. 

These users can be given the rights:
- View project documents and results
- Add/Modify ... project documents and results
- Add/Manage Users for the project
- Design - modify the structure of the project's logframe, etc

Each of these permissions can be granted for the user's OrganizationalUnit or for all participating OrgUnits

=== OrganizationalUnit-level Permissions ===

In addition to project-level permissions, certain users may be granted permission at the Organizational level, which grants them the rights to data associated with the OrgUnit, (e.g. Security Incidents) as well as over all projects associated with the OrgUnit, or a descendant OrgUnit.  

Not all users associated with an OrgUnit (a field office, for example) would be granted automatic rights on all projects -- a field office can have 50+ staff and dozens of projects, so this kind of right would be reserved for Chiefs of Mission or Logistics Coordinator, etc. The rest of field office's staff would receive their rights on a project-by-project basis. 

== Mapping to the existing ActivityInfo model ==

With the proposed modifications above, the existing ActivityInfo model maps cleanly onto that required for the ECHO project:
