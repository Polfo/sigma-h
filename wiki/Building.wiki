#summary Guide to building Sigmah on Windows

#sidebar ContributorGuideSideBar

= Introduction =

This guide assumes that you're using Windows. 

== Tools to download and Install ==

Some of the functionality below is available through Eclipse or IntelliJ, but at some point you'll probably want to make a quick call to the command line.

  # [http://download.java.net/jdk6/ JDK, v1.6]
  # [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads Tortoise SVN] - Windows explorer client for Subversion Version Control System
  # [http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion/ CollabNet Subversion Command-Line Client] - Command-line client for Windows
  # [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Apache Maven] - a build manager for Java. You just need to unzip it in the c:\Program Files folder.
  # Add the paths to the JDK, CollabNet subversion, and Maven paths to the path environment variable. (instructions for [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm XP] [http://www.question-defense.com/2009/06/22/modify-a-users-path-in-windows-vista-vista-path-environment-variable/ Vista]
  # [http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ MySQL v5]

*Note:* Microsoft SQL server is no longer a supported database. We are now actively testing against MySQL 5.x and PostgreSQL.

== Quick build ==

We'll get to the IDE in a moment, but first it would be good to confirm that you can successfully build Sigmah/ActivityInfo

  # Checkout a working copy 
{{{
svn checkout http://sigma-h.googlecode.com/svn/trunk sigmah
}}}
  # Change directory to the working copy
{{{
cd sigmah
}}}
  # Invoke the Maven compile and test phases
{{{
mvn test
}}}

Maven will automatically download all required dependencies, compile the project, and run unit and integration tests against an embedded database. 

== Setting up a development database ==

Out of the box, Sigmah will run against H2, an embedded database. As a developer, you will probably want to develop against a running database like MySQL that you can easily inspect and manipulate. 

You can tell sigmah to connect to your local database by creating a sigmah.properties file and saving it to your home directory. (C:\Users\XXXX on Windows Vista and later)

hibernate.connection.password=adminpwd
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/sigmah

In order to populate your database with default data, you can run step by step all the SQL scripts contained in this zip file: [https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0Bzg6KaEX0htuMTk4NzFmOWUtNGUyMi00ZjAxLWJkMWQtNmJjZTQ3MjhjMDMy&export=download&hl=en sigmah-postgresql-0.6.2.zip] (for PostGreSQL database)

== Starting GWT development mode ==

For the time being, we are maintaining two separate GWT entry points: ActivityInfoEntryPoint, which will continue to meet the day-to-day needs of existing users, and SigmahEntryPoint, which adds a great deal of new functionality but is not yet ready for production use. 

You can launch GWT development mode for ActivityInfo by running
{{{
mvn gwt:run
}}}

and 
{{{
mvn -P Sigmah gwt:run
}}}

for the Sigmah module
