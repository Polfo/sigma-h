#summary Guide to building ActivityInfo on Windows

= Introduction =

This guide assumes that you're using Windows

== Tools to download and Install ==

Some of the functionality below is available through Eclipse or IntelliJ, but at some point you'll probably want to make a quick call to the command line.

  # [http://download.java.net/jdk6/ JDK, v1.6]
  # [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads Tortoise SVN] - Windows explorer client for Subversion Version Control System
  # [http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion/ CollabNet Subversion Command-Line Client] - Command-line client for Windows
  # [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Apache Maven] - a build manager for Java. You just need to unzip it in the c:\Program Files folder.
  # Add the paths to the JDK, CollabNet subversion, and Maven paths to the path environment variable. (instructions for [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm XP] [http://www.question-defense.com/2009/06/22/modify-a-users-path-in-windows-vista-vista-path-environment-variable/ Vista]
  # [http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2005/en/us/express-down.aspx Microsoft SQL Server Express 2005]

== Quick build ==

We'll get to the IDE in a moment, but first it would be good to confirm that you can successfully build ActivityInfo

  # Checkout a working copy 
{{{
svn checkout svn checkout http://activity-info.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/activityinfo 
}}}
  # Change directory to the working copy
{{{
cd activityinfo
}}}
  # Invoke the Maven compile phase
{{{
mvn compile
}}}

Maven will automatically download all required dependencies and compile the project.

== Setting up the development and testing databases == 

  # First, you need to enable TCP/IP support on Microsoft SQL Server Express and allow database authentication. See  [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;914277 here] and  . Set the password for `sa` to `adminpwd`.
  # Create an empty database called `actinfo` as the development database
  # Create an empty database called `act-test` as the test database
  # From the folder `activityinfo\application`, execute
{{{
mvn hibernate3:hbm2ddl
}}}

This will create the tables, etc in your development database.

== Running ActivityInfo Tests == 

Verify that everything is in good order by running 
{{{
mvn test
}}}

== Starting GWT development mode ==

You can launch GWT development mode by running
{{{
mvn gwt:run
}}}

Navigate to the URL provided by the development mode module.
